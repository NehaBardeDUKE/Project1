## Information redaction microservice based on IAM

Based on the person requesting the information, take data from an Azure database and provide a descriptive file containing only the information that is required for that access level.

Ex: FERPA requires students to be non identifiable and only the students to have access to their educational info. So if a mental health professional needs a student's info the microservice will provide required statistics (like how is the student's performance looking) instead of the actual data.

Rough Idea:
